      <h3 class="advice__title">Confusion is your friend.</h3>
      <p>Sounds weird, I know, but hear me out. When you start      programming your first web app you are doing something that you have <i>never</i> done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

      <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that <b>you are heading in the right direction</b>. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits. You can do this!</p>

    <h3 class="advice__title">Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h3>
      <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

      <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a <i>critical</i> part of the process.</p>

      <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
      
    <h3 class="advice__title">YOU. CAN. DO. THIS.</h3>
      <p>Coding, programming, and coming up with all these great ideas you want to make happen are a wonderful, rewarding, and challenging part of learning these new skills. You will have moments where you are absolutely in awe of what you just created, and there will be moments of absolute frustration. <b>Don't give up in a moment of upset</b>. You are capable, you are smart, and you will get it. Take a break, have a little snack, come back to it later. A clear mind does wonders. Just remember that you are amazing, you are incredible, and you will no be defeated by a little bit of code! You've got this!</p>
